HSDS - Highly Scaleable Data Service
====================================

The HSDS is a Restful web service for working with HDF5 data.

`HDF5 <https://hdfgroup.org>`_ lets you store huge amounts of numerical
data, and easily manipulate that data from NumPy. For example, you can slice
into multi-terabyte datasets stored on disk, as if they were real NumPy
arrays. Thousands of datasets can be stored in a single file, categorized and
tagged however you want.
