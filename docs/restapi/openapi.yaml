      summary: Create a new Domain
      description: >
        Domains represent collections of groups, datasets, and committed datatypes
        analogous to hdf5 files.

        Folders are domains which lack a root Group. Their
        main use is to provide a directory-like way to group other domains.
         
        Note: Initially, the only object in a Domain is the root group. Use
        other `put` and `post` operations to create new group, datasets, or 
        committed datatypes in the domain.

        Note: Domains (and Folders) may only be created as direct children
        of existing Domains. e.g., `/home/user/project/missing_folder/` *must*
        exist prior to the creation of Domain
        `/home/user/project/missing_folder/data.h5`, otherwise Error 404 will be returned.

        Note: The operation will fail if the domain already exists
        (Error 409).

        In addition to creation new domains, this operation can also be used with existing domains
        to flush recent changes to the domain to storage (see `flush` parameter) or force
        a rescanning operation (see `rescan`).
