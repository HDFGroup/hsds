HSDS is a web service that implements a REST-based web service for HDF5 data stores.
Data can be stored in either a POSIX files system, or using object-based storage such as
AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or [MinIO](https://min.io).
HSDS can be run a single machine or on a cluster using Kubernetes (or AKS on Microsoft Azure).

In addition, HSDS can b  e run in serverless mode with AWS Lambda or h5pyd local mode.
