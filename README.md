# HSDS (Highly Scalable Data Service) - REST-based service for HDF5 data

## Introduction

HSDS is a web service that implements a REST-based web service for HDF5 data stores.
Data can be stored in either a POSIX files system, or using object-based storage such as
AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or [MinIO](https://min.io).
HSDS can be run a single machine with or without Docker or on a cluster using Kubernetes (or AKS on Microsoft Azure).

In addition, HSDS can be run in serverless mode with AWS Lambda or h5pyd local mode.

## Quick Start

Make sure you have Python 3 and Pip installed, then:

1.  Run install: `$ ./build.sh --nolint` from source tree OR install from pypi: `$ pip install hsds`
2.  Create a directory the server will use to store data, example: `$ mkdir ~/hsds_data`
3.  Start server: `$ hsds --root_dir ~/hsds_data`
4.  Run the test suite. In a separate terminal run:
    -  Set user_name: `$ export USER_NAME=$USER`
    -  Set user_password: `$ export USER_PASSWORD=$USER`
    -  Set admin name: `$ export ADMIN_USERNAME=$USER`
    -  Set admin password: `$ $export ADMIN_PASSWORD=$USER`
    -  Run test suite: `$ python testall.py --skip_unit`
5. (Optional) Install the h5pyd package for an h5py compatible api and tool suite: https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5pyd
6. (Optional) Post install setup (test data, home folders, cli tools, etc): [docs/post_install.md](docs/post_install.md)

To shut down the server, and the server is not running in Docker, just control-C.

If using docker, run: `$ ./stopall.sh`

Note: passwords can (and should for production use) be modified by changing values in hsds/admin/config/password.txt and rebuilding the docker image. Alternatively, an external identity provider such as Azure Active Directory or KeyCloak can be used. See: [docs/azure_ad_setup.md](docs/azure_ad_setup.md) for Azure AD setup instructions or [docs/keycloak_setup.md](docs/keycloak_setup.md) for KeyCloak.

## General Install Topics

Setting up docker:

- See [docs/setup_docker.md](docs/setup_docker.md)

Post install setup and testing:

- See [docs/post_install.md](docs/post_install.md)

Authorization, ACLs, and Role Based Access Control (RBAC):

- See [docs/authorization.md](docs/authorization.md)

Running serverless with h5pyd:

- See <https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5pyd/blob/master/README.rst>

## Writing Client Applications

As a REST service, clients be developed using almost any programming language. The
test programs under: hsds/test/integ illustrate some of the methods for performing
different operations using Python and HSDS REST API (using the requests package).

The related project: <https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5pyd> provides a (mostly) h5py-compatible
interface to the server for Python clients.

For C/C++ clients, the HDF REST VOL is a HDF5 library plugin that enables the HDF5 API to read and write data
using HSDS. See: <https://github.com/HDFGroup/vol-rest>. Note: requires v1.12.0 or greater version of the HDF5 library.

## Uninstalling

HSDS only modifies the storage location that it is configured to use, so to uninstall just remove
source files, Docker images, and S3 bucket/Azure Container/directory files.

## Reporting bugs (and general feedback)

Create new issues at <http://github.com/HDFGroup/hsds/issues> for any problems you find.

## Integration with JupyterHub

The HDF Group provides access to an HSDS instance that is integrated with JupyterLab: HDF Lab. HDF Lab is a hosted Jupyter environment with these features:

- Connection to a HSDS instance
- Dedicated Xeon core per user
- 10 GB Posix Disk
- 200 GB S3 storage for HDF data
- Sample programs and data files

Sign up for HDF Lab here: <https://www.hdfgroup.org/hdfkitalab/>.

## Azure Marketplace

VM Offer for Azure Marketplace. HSDS for Azure Marketplace provides an easy way to
setup a Azure instance with HSDS. See: <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/thehdfgroup1616725197741.hsdsazurevm?tab=Overview> for more information.
