HSDS (Highly Scalable Data Service) - REST-based service for HDF5 data
======================================================================
 
Introduction
------------

HSDS is a web service that implements a REST-based web service for HDF5 data stores.
Data can be stored in either a POSIX files system, or using object based storage such as
AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or OpenIO <openio.io>.
HSDS can be run a single machine using Docker or on a cluster using Kubernetes (or AKS on Microsoft Azure)
The commercial offering based on this code is known as Kita&trade;.

Quick Start
-------------

Make sure you have Python 3, docker, docker-compose installed, then:

   1. Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/HDFGroup/hsds`
   2. Go to the hsds directory: `$ cd hsds`
   3. Run install: `$ python setup.py install`
   4. Setup password file: `$ cp admin/config/passwd.default admin/config/passwd.txt`
   5. Create a directory the server will use to store data, and then set the ROOT_DIR environment variable to point to it: `$ mkdir ~/hsds_data; export ROOT_DIR="${HOME}/hsds_data"`
   6. Start server: `$ ./runall.sh`
   7. Try making a request to the service: `$ curl http://localhost:5101/about` (should get back a json response)
   8. Set environment variables for the admin password and username: `$ export ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin`, `$ export ADMIN_USERNAME=admin`
   9. Run the test suite: `$ python testall.py --skip_unit`
   10. (Optional) Post install setup (test data, home folders, cli tools, etc): [docs/post_install.md](docs/post_install.md)


To shut down the server, run: `$ ./stopall.sh`
    
Note: passwords can (and should for production use) be modified by changing values in hsds/admin/config/password.txt and rebuilding the docker image.  Alternatively, an external identity provider such as Azure Active Directory or KeyCloak can be used.  See: [docs/azure_ad_setup.md](docs/azure_ad_setup.md) for Azure AD setup instructions or [docs/keycloak_setup.md](docs/keycloak_setup.md) for KeyCloak.

Detailed Install Instructions
-----------------------------

**On AWS**

See: [docs/docker_install_aws.md](docs/docker_install_aws.md) for complete install instructions.

See: [docs/kubernetes_install_aws.md](docs/kubernetes_install_aws.md) for setup on Kubernetes.

**On Azure** 

For complete instructions to install on a single Azure VM:
- See: [docs/docker_install_azure.md](docs/docker_install_azure.md)

For complete instructions to install on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
- See: [docs/kubernetes_install_azure.md](docs/kubernetes_install_azure.md)

**On Prem (POSIX-based storage)** 

For complete instructions to install on a desktop or local server:
- See: [docs/docker_install_posix.md](docs/docker_install_posix.md)

**On DCOS** **(BETA)**

For complete instructions to install on DCOS:
- See: [docs/docker_install_dcos.md](docs/docker_install_dcos.md)

**General Install Topics**

Setting up docker:
- See [docs/setup_docker.md](docs/setup_docker.md)

Post install setup and testing:
- See [docs/post_install.md](docs/post_install.md)

Authorization, ACLs, and Role Based Access Control (RBAC):
- See [docs/authorization.mid](docs/authorization.md)

Writing Client Applications
----------------------------

As a REST service, clients be developed using almost any programming language.  The
test programs under: hsds/test/integ illustrate some of the methods for performing
different operations using Python and HSDS REST API (using the requests package).

The related project: <https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5pyd> provides a (mostly) h5py-compatible
interface to the server for Python clients.

For C/C++ clients, the HDF REST VOL is a HDF5 library plugin that enables the HDF5 API to read and write data
using HSDS.  See: <https://github.com/HDFGroup/vol-rest>. Note: requires v1.12.0 or greater version of the HDF5 library.

Uninstalling
------------

HSDS only modifies the storage location that it is configured to use, so to uninstall just remove
source files, Docker images, and S3 bucket/Azure Container/directory files.
